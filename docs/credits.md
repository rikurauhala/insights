## Data

Data used by the application is provided by GitHub via the [REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest).

## User interface

UI elements and icons by [Material UI](https://mui.com). Charts were made with [MUI X Charts](https://mui.com/x/react-charts/).

The word cloud visualization used in the application is based on [react-wordcloud](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-wordcloud) by [Chris Zhou](https://github.com/chrisrzhou). However, a [fork](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cyberblast/react-wordcloud) made by [cyberblast](https://github.com/cyberblast) was used for its React 18 support.

## Misc

Programming language color codes are based on the [Linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist) project by GitHub. More specifically, the colors are taken from the [language.yml](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml) file. The file [colors.json](../src/utils/colors.json) has been manually created by [Riku Rauhala](https://github.com/rikurauhala) based on languages.yml.

The colors.json was last updated on 19 April 2024. Some languages could be missing.

Here is a [Python script](./scripts/linguist.py) that can be used to update the `colors.json` file.

```python
import requests
import yaml

YAML_URL = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github-linguist/linguist/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml'
JSON_FILE = 'colors.json'

response = requests.get(YAML_URL)
if response.status_code != 200:
    print(f'Failed to fetch YAML file: {response.status_code}')
    exit()

yaml_data = response.text
languages = yaml.safe_load(yaml_data)
with open(JSON_FILE, 'w') as json_file:
    json_file.write('{\n')
    for key, value in languages.items():
        try:
            color = value['color'].lower()
            json_file.write(f'  "{key}": "{color}",\n')
        except KeyError:
            pass
    json_file.seek(json_file.tell() - 2, 0)
    json_file.truncate()
    json_file.write('\n}\n')

print(f'Data written to {JSON_FILE}')
```
